Here's a step-by-step guide on how to run the program, assuming you don't have any software installed:

Step 1:Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

Visit the official Oracle website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
Download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) for your operating system.


Step 2:Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, which is a popular free IDE for Java development.
Visit the official IntelliJ IDEA website: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
Download and install the Community Edition for your operating system.


Step 3:Install MongoDB

Visit the official MongoDB website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
Download and install the MongoDB Community Server for your operating system.


Step 4:Set up a new Spring Boot project

Open IntelliJ IDEA and click on "Create New Project."
In the project wizard, select "Spring Initializr" and click "Next."
Choose the required project metadata (e.g., Group, Artifact, and package name).
Select the required Spring Boot version (e.g., 2.7.x).
Add the required dependencies:
Here i have used two dependencies
1:Spring Web
2:Spring Data MongoDB

Click "Next" and choose the project location.
Click "Finish" to generate the project.

Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA

If you haven't already, open IntelliJ IDEA.
Click "Open" or "Import Project" and navigate to the directory where you generated the project.
Select the project and click "Open."


Step 5:Configure MongoDB connection

Open the application.properties or application.yml file in the src/main/resources directory.
Add the MongoDB connection URI:
 For application.properties

spring.data.mongodb.uri=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name

Replace your-database-name with the name of your desired database.


Step 6:Install MongoDB Compass (optional)

MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface for MongoDB that can help you visualize and manage your data.
Visit the official MongoDB Compass website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass
Download and install MongoDB Compass for your operating system.

Run the application

In IntelliJ IDEA, locate the main class of your Spring Boot application (typically, a class with the
@SpringBootApplication annotation).
Right-click on the main class and select "Run" or click the "Run" button in the toolbar.
The application should start, and you should see the Spring Boot banner in the console.


Step 7:Test the application

You can use tools like Postman or curl to send HTTP requests to your application's endpoints.
For example, if you have an endpoint /api/appointments that accepts a POST request with request
 parameters like startTime, endTime, and operatorName, you can send a request using Postman or curl.


Step 8:Explore MongoDB data

If you installed MongoDB Compass, you can open it and connect to your local MongoDB instance.
You should see the database and collections you're working with in your application.
You can explore the data, run queries, and perform various operations on your MongoDB data.
